# TOPSIS Decision Support System

This repository presents an implementation of the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method as a complete **decision-support system**.  
The project demonstrates how TOPSIS can be applied through multiple interfaces for real-world decision-making problems.

---

## 📌 Methodology

The TOPSIS methodology followed in this project consists of the following stages:

- Input of decision data using a CSV file  
- Validation of numerical values, weights, and impacts  
- Normalization and application of weights  
- Identification of ideal best and ideal worst solutions  
- Calculation of TOPSIS scores and ranking of alternatives
